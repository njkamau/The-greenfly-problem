# The-greenfly-problem
Greenfly can reproduce asexually. After one week of life a lone female can produce eight
offspring a day. Starting at the beginning of day 1 with a single mature female, how many
greenfly could there be by the end of day 28? It may be assumed that:
• There are no deaths
• All offspring are females
Note that at the end of day 1 there will be 9 greenfly (original + 8 offspring). At the end
of day 7 there will be 57 greenfly (original + 8 × 7 offspring). At the end of day 8 there
will be 129 greenfly (original + 8 × 8 offspring + 64 offspring from the daughters produced
on day 1)
